# ReactiveFlow

This repository contains functions used to simulate the chemical and physical consequences of reactive flow within a cumulate mush.

The functions included in this repository are written for MATLAB R2018b and require the alphaMELTS for MATLAB packages (Dec 2020),

Functions include:
  1. AFC - Assimilation Fractional Crystallisation calculations. Set the composition of initial melt and initial mush and then follow the composition of the melt phase through processive reaction with that surrounding mush zone.
